  "ID": "Char.Clown",
  "Name": "Jester",
  "Description": "Yet another remnant of the Middle Ages, though from a similar time period this Jester had quite an important job in his kingdom. Each year he had to perform one jump, a whistle, and a fart for his beloved king. His king loved this performance so much that he even gifted this Jester a manor and some land. However, through much of the year this poor jester was bored out of his mind and did not have much to do and felt a lack of purpose and would often wander his own halls aimlessly. The founder noticing this decided to give him a renewed sense of purpose to entertain not just himself but crowds of peoples as well and thus transported the jester to his gameshow.",

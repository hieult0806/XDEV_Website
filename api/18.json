  "ID": "Char.Thief",
  "Name": "Thug",
  "Description": "Thug has always had a rough life, though a thief by profession, he has proven himself to be quite agile. Sure he is a criminal, but has taken a vow to not hurt those he steals from and even donates what he manages to steal to charities of his choosing. It is uncertain if it his own way of making up for his crimes or to clear his conscience but just because he is a bad guy as he says it does not mean he is a “bad guy.” Unfortunately for him he was caught by the Scotland Yard and brought to jail, but before the cell could be locked he was instantly teleported to the gameshow by the founder who had taken an interest in this unique criminal.

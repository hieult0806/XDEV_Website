  "Description": "Jonny is an intrepid adventurer, a genius, so much so that he had accomplished much what he wanted to do in his life, so he became an astronaut. While doing some repairs on a routine spacewalk he was knocked off his ship by some space debris and while floating in the void was rescued by the founder and brought to his game show. The founder offered Jonny a new experience, a new challenge, new rewards, which Jonny accepted and chose over floating endlessly of the vastness of space. \r\n",

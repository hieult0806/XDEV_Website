  "Name": "McCluck",
  "Description": "McCluck, a genetically engineered human sized rooster. He was accidentally created in a lab that was experimenting on genetically engineering chicken that would have no feathers and heads to make it easier for a fast food franchise to produce chicken meat for their ravenous customers. Unfortunately, or rather fortunately for McCluck the scientist in charge accidentally dropped a piece of his own DNA, a strand of his hair into the cloning vat and thus created McCluck. After gaining awareness of his situation after inheriting not only the humanoid shape and size but also his donorâ€™s intellect, he bravely escaped and swore an oath to free all the chickens from captivity. Shortly after his escape the founder amused and bewildered by this unique specimen teleported him into the games to give him a shot at earning enough to build his own laboratory and clone himself to take over the chicken farms and rescue his clucking comrades.",

<p><strong>5. Disclosure and Transfer of Personal Data</strong></p>
<p>Personal data may be disclosed in accordance with applicable legislation and this Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>XDEV Studio may hire agents and contractors to collect and process personal data on XDEV Studio’s behalf and in such cases such agents and contractors will be instructed to comply with our Privacy Policy and to use personal data only for the purposes for which the third party has been engaged by XDEV Studio. These agents and contractors may not use your personal data for their own marketing purposes. XDEV Studio may use third party service providers such as credit card processors, e-mail service providers, shipping agents, data analyzers and business intelligence providers. XDEV Studio has the right to share your personal data as necessary for the aforementioned third parties to provide their services for XDEV Studio. XDEV Studio is not liable for the acts and omissions of these third parties, except as provided by mandatory law.</p>
<p>XDEV Studio may disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or may expose you or XDEV Studio to legal liability. XDEV Studio may also disclose your personal data to third parties when XDEV Studio has a reason to believe that a disclosure is necessary to address potential or actual injury or interference with XDEV Studio’s rights, property, operations, users or others who may be harmed or may suffer loss or damage, or XDEV Studio believes that such disclosure is necessary to protect XDEV Studio’s rights, combat fraud and/or comply with a judicial proceeding, court order, or legal process served on XDEV Studio. To the extent permitted by applicable law, XDEV Studio will make reasonable efforts to notify you of such disclosure through XDEV Studio’s website or in another reasonable manner.</p>
<p><strong>6. Data Retention and Correctness</strong></p>
<p>XDEV Studio retains the data collected pursuant to this Privacy Policy for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Thereafter if the collected data is no longer needed for purposes specified in this Privacy Policy, XDEV Studio deletes all aforementioned data in its possession within a reasonable timeframe. XDEV Studio does not verify the correctness of personal data.</p>
<p>Irrespective of the above, XDEV Studio may still retain some of the data to the extent such retention is necessary to resolve disputes, enforce XDEV Studio user agreements, and comply with technical and legal requirements and constraints related to the security, integrity and operation of Services.</p>

You recognize and agree that XDEV Studio is not liable for any such third party terms and conditions and their use of your personal data.</p>
<p>XDEV Studio may in its discretion make available links through advertisements or otherwise enable you to access third party products or services.

The fact that XDEV Studio is linking to those products or services does not constitute our sponsorship of, or affiliation with, those people or companies.</p>
<p>XDEV Studio may from time to time make available XDEV Studio’s partners’ services, such as sweepstakes or polls and such services may require you to disclose personal data in order to register for and access such services. Such services will reasonably identify the partners at the point of where you are required to disclose personal data.

When you register to join or use the Services from a third-party gaming or social networking system, certain personally identifiable user and/or membership data may be transferred automatically to and from XDEV Studio and you hereby consent to the processing, using, combining, disclosing and retaining of such data in accordance with this Privacy Policy by XDEV Studio.</p>
<p><strong>8. Safeguards</strong></p>
<p>XDEV Studio follows generally accepted industry standards and maintains reasonable safeguards to attempt to ensure the security, integrity and privacy of the information in XDEV Studio’s possession. Only those persons with a need to process your personal data in connection with the fulfillment of their tasks in accordance with the purposes of this Privacy Policy and for the purposes of performing technical maintenance have access to your personal data in XDEV Studio’s possession. Personal data collected by XDEV Studio is stored in secure operating environments that are not available to the public. To prevent unauthorized on-line access to personal data, XDEV Studio maintains personal data behind a firewall-protected server. However, no system can be 100% secure and there is the possibility that despite XDEV Studio’s reasonable efforts, there could be unauthorized access to your personal data. By using the Services, you assume this risk.</p>

XDEV Studio does not knowingly collect any personal information from children under 13 years of age and if XDEV Studio learns that XDEV Studio has inadvertently gathered personal data from children under 13 years of age, XDEV Studio will take reasonable measures to promptly erase such personal data from XDEV Studio’s records.</p>
<p>XDEV Studio may store and/or transfer your personal data to its affiliates and partners in and outside of EU/EEA member states and the United States in accordance with mandatory legislation and this Privacy Policy. XDEV Studio may disclose your personal data to third parties in connection with a corporate merger, consolidation, restructuring, the sale of substantially all of XDEV Studio’s stock and/or assets or other corporate change, including, without limitation, during the course of any due diligence process provided, however, that this Privacy Policy shall continue to govern such personal data.</p>
<p>XDEV Studio makes good faith efforts to enable you to review, update or correct your personal data in XDEV Studio’s possession. In order to do so, please contact XDEV Studio at info@XDEV Studio.com. XDEV Studio will need sufficient information from you to establish your identity and to verify your access request, and also to assist us in handling your request.

<p>XDEV Studio regularly reviews its compliance with this Privacy Policy. If XDEV Studio receives a formal written complaint from you, XDEV Studio will attempt to contact you directly to address any of your concerns. XDEV Studio will cooperate with the appropriate governmental authorities, including data protection authorities, to resolve any complaints regarding the collection, use, transfer or disclosure of personal data that cannot be amicably resolved between you and XDEV Studio.
